Description: An experimental study of language models, corpus design
    and word prediction efficacy in four phases. The initial phase was
    an exploratory data analysis of the English language HC Corpus, 
    a collection of freely available texts comprised of over 2.5 billion 
    words from 67 languages. Next, linquistically representative 
    corpora of various  sizes were built and training, validation,
    and test sets were preprocesed for modeling. The subsequent language
    modeling phase concerned the implementation of Good-Turing / Katz,
    Kneser Ney, Modified Kneser-Ney and Topic Model language models.
    Finally, the language models were executed on corpora of various sizes
    and word prediction perplexity measures were taken to illuminate
    word prediction accuracy.
